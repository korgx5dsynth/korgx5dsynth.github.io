<p>PROGRAMMING</p>
I specialized in the development of tightly-integrated crytographic applications in C and Java. I specialized on programming languages interoperation and extension on C/C++, Java, Python, Javascript/Typescript including binary component models such as .so, .dll, COM, Java Beans, CORBA. I have no preference and can program on anything that has a CPU/compiler (SIM card, mainframes, microcontrollers, PSP Playstation, TI calculators, Android, NFC stickers, Mifare cards, Java Cards). Worked on Docker/Kubernetes.
